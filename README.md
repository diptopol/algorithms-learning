# Algorithms-Learning

The goal of this project is to learn algorithms. The implementations will be done in JAVA. The implementation should also include the complexity as Java Documentation. This will ensure that authors are aware of memory and time complexity of their solutions.

The list of algorithms:
- Sorting Algorithms
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Heap Sort

# Contribution Policy

Authors should work on separate branch for their implementations. Then the implementations will be reviewed by the authors themselves. For review purpose pull request should be created. Authors can not push their codes directly to `main` branch. This approach will ensure that authors are well knowledgable about the code review and merging process.

## Coding and Git Conventions:
- Branch name should start with `feature/{branch_name}` except `main`. Here `{branch_name}` is a placeholder.
- Branch name cannot contain any empty space. Hyphen is preferred over underscore.
- Commit message should clearly explain the code change done in that particular commit.
- Method name should be self explanatory.
